READ_ME 

Whenever you make changes to ANY file checkout the read-me branch and update the readme
,otherwise I have to review all your code to see what changes you made. Always document
with comments for things you believe the other person might not understand. 



Git Notes:
- Name branches based on what you worked on. It's harder to know what your branch does
  when you name something as an abbreviation. Examples of appropriate branch names:
  read-me, error-checks, variable-changes, etc.

- make clean before commiting any changes. failure to make clean will
  result in extra "~" files in the repsository




Completed Tasks: 
- makefile was modified to compile using our group letter P
- run "make submit" in the command line which auto submits to 
  the dropbox
- look at the differences between expected output and ours, making changes 
  where necessary
